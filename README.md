Issues experienced:
1. I received several errors in my bash while trying to npm run build, but the very last time I ran it, everything seemed to compile correctly -- not sure if I did anything differently
2. I continued to receive an error in the console, "main.js:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'Desserts' has already been declared
    at main.js:1," even though Desserts, the parent class, had not already been defined -not sure why this occurred or kept popping up.
3. I had some trouble with adding the includeSpoon method to the Ice Cream subclass; I think it is now running as it is supposed to, but any advice on how to do this better/more efficiently would be appreciated!
